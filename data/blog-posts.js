      'Yes. Audible Read & Listen highlights the Kindle text word by word while the narrator reads, and you can switch between listening and reading along at any time.',
      'You need both editions on the same Amazon account: the audiobook in your Audible library and the Kindle ebook in your Kindle library. The title must be marked Read & Listen, formerly Whispersync for Voice-ready.',
      'In the Audible app, filter your Library by Read & Listen, start the book, and use the toggle above the cover to switch modes.',
      'Audible announced the current version in February 2026, starting in the US with the UK, Australia and Germany planned next. Check your country before buying.',

      ['Can you read along with Audible?', 'Yes, for eligible titles. Audible Read & Listen shows the Kindle ebook text and highlights each word as the narrator reads it. You need both the Audible audiobook and the Kindle ebook of the same title on your Amazon account.'],
      ['How do I turn on Read & Listen in the Audible app?', 'Open your Library, use the Read & Listen filter or look for the badge next to a cover, start playing the book, and use the toggle above the cover image to switch from Listen to Read & Listen.'],
      ['Do I have to buy the Kindle ebook to read along on Audible?', 'Yes. Audible does not bundle the two formats. If you already own the Kindle ebook, Amazon often offers the matching audiobook at a discount as an option to add Audible narration.'],
      ['Does Read & Listen work on a Kindle e-reader?', 'Audible lists its iPhone, iPad, Android and Android tablet apps, Fire tablets running Fire OS 8 or later, and its macOS app as supported. Kindle e-readers are not on that list.'],
      ['Is Audible Read & Listen available in my country?', 'At its February 2026 launch it started in the US, with the UK, Australia and Germany planned over the following months. Check the Audible help pages for your country.'],
      ['Can I read along with an audiobook that is not from Audible?', 'Audible Read & Listen only covers titles in your Audible and Kindle libraries. For MP3 or M4B files you can legally import, such as LibriVox recordings, HushBook transcribes the audio on your phone and highlights each word as the narrator reads.'],
      ['Can HushBook open Audible audiobooks or Kindle ebooks?', 'No. Protected Audible downloads and Kindle ebooks are locked to Amazon apps, so HushBook cannot import them. If your books are in Audible and Kindle, use Read & Listen.']

    takeaways: [
      'Immersive reading means reading the words while listening to the same book, either with an app that highlights each word or with a book on your lap and headphones on.',
      'An audiobook already has a human narrator; a text-to-speech reader turns a document into computer speech. Read-along for an audiobook needs text that follows that specific recording.',
      'Microsoft Immersive Reader and Edge Reading mode work on digital text such as web pages. They are not an audiobook library.',
      'Audible announced Read & Listen in February 2026 for eligible Audible and Kindle editions, starting in the US. Check it before buying another copy.',
      'HushBook transcribes an audiobook file you can legally import (MP3 or M4B) on your phone and highlights each word in time with the narrator, offline.'
    ],
    faqs: [
      ['What is immersive reading?', 'Immersive reading is reading the words of a book while listening to the same book being narrated. An app can highlight each word as the narrator speaks it, or you can follow a printed or ebook edition while the audiobook plays.'],
      ['How do I read and listen to a book at the same time?', 'Start with what you already have: play the audiobook and follow a matching edition of the text for a few pages. Check that both editions match, since abridged recordings or different introductions will not line up. If you keep losing your place, a read-along app that highlights the current word gives you a point to return to.'],
      ['Is Microsoft Immersive Reader the same as reading along with an audiobook?', 'No. Microsoft Immersive Reader and Reading mode in Edge are tools for digital text. They can simplify a web page, change how text looks, and read it aloud with a computer voice. They do not follow a recorded audiobook narrator.'],
      ['Does Audible have a read-along feature?', 'Audible announced Read & Listen in February 2026. It pairs eligible audiobook and ebook editions from your Audible and Kindle libraries and highlights the text with the narration. The announcement described a US rollout first, and you may need both formats.'],
      ['Can HushBook play Audible audiobooks?', 'No. Protected Audible downloads cannot be imported into HushBook. HushBook works with audio files you can legally import, such as MP3 or M4B files and public-domain recordings from LibriVox.'],
      ['Does reading while listening help with ADHD or dyslexia?', 'Some readers find that seeing the words helps them stay with a chapter, and Understood describes audiobooks and text-to-speech as reading supports. Its expert-reviewed guide also says assistive tools alone probably will not improve reading skills, and an app does not replace teaching or treatment for ADHD or dyslexia.'],
      ['Do I need the ebook to use HushBook read-along?', 'No. HushBook creates a transcript from the audio on your phone, so you do not need to buy the ebook. The transcript comes from speech recognition, so names or noisy recordings can contain mistakes.']
