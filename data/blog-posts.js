    takeaways: [
      'Immersive reading means reading the words while listening to the same book, either with an app that highlights each word or with a book on your lap and headphones on.',
      'An audiobook already has a human narrator; a text-to-speech reader turns a document into computer speech. Read-along for an audiobook needs text that follows that specific recording.',
      'Microsoft Immersive Reader and Edge Reading mode work on digital text such as web pages. They are not an audiobook library.',
      'Audible announced Read & Listen in February 2026 for eligible Audible and Kindle editions, starting in the US. Check it before buying another copy.',
      'HushBook transcribes an audiobook file you can legally import (MP3 or M4B) on your phone and highlights each word in time with the narrator, offline.'
    ],
    faqs: [
      ['What is immersive reading?', 'Immersive reading is reading the words of a book while listening to the same book being narrated. An app can highlight each word as the narrator speaks it, or you can follow a printed or ebook edition while the audiobook plays.'],
      ['How do I read and listen to a book at the same time?', 'Start with what you already have: play the audiobook and follow a matching edition of the text for a few pages. Check that both editions match, since abridged recordings or different introductions will not line up. If you keep losing your place, a read-along app that highlights the current word gives you a point to return to.'],
      ['Is Microsoft Immersive Reader the same as reading along with an audiobook?', 'No. Microsoft Immersive Reader and Reading mode in Edge are tools for digital text. They can simplify a web page, change how text looks, and read it aloud with a computer voice. They do not follow a recorded audiobook narrator.'],
      ['Does Audible have a read-along feature?', 'Audible announced Read & Listen in February 2026. It pairs eligible audiobook and ebook editions from your Audible and Kindle libraries and highlights the text with the narration. The announcement described a US rollout first, and you may need both formats.'],
      ['Can HushBook play Audible audiobooks?', 'No. Protected Audible downloads cannot be imported into HushBook. HushBook works with audio files you can legally import, such as MP3 or M4B files and public-domain recordings from LibriVox.'],
      ['Does reading while listening help with ADHD or dyslexia?', 'Some readers find that seeing the words helps them stay with a chapter, and Understood describes audiobooks and text-to-speech as reading supports. Its expert-reviewed guide also says assistive tools alone probably will not improve reading skills, and an app does not replace teaching or treatment for ADHD or dyslexia.'],
      ['Do I need the ebook to use HushBook read-along?', 'No. HushBook creates a transcript from the audio on your phone, so you do not need to buy the ebook. The transcript comes from speech recognition, so names or noisy recordings can contain mistakes.']
